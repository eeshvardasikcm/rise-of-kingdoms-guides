# Alliance shop
Alliance ranked number four members and Alliance leaders can load the Alliance shop up with inventory.
## individual and city development theory behind Alliance shops
The Alliance Shop is for giving back to individual Alliance members that have helped the Alliance grow.
most alliance leaders Will be excited to build flags for their alliance and put lower priority on the shop items.
Rise of Kingdoms gives the option for the Alliance leader to allow extra rewards for their individual members.
One of the biggest shop items that gives a alliance member reward is the civilization change item.
many members may feel purchasing a targeted teleport or an alliance teleport from the Alliance shop is a better value than buying elsewhere.
providing alliance members with options to spend their alliance credits down to zero before they leave to go to another alliance, is a good way to make sure that temporary members have a positive experience in your alliance.
## Alliance shop and member cost ratio theory
items in the Alliance shop cost less for the alliance to purchase, then they do for the alliance members to purchase.
when a member uses Alliance credits to purchase from the Alliance shop, they give themselves another option for acquiring valuable items.
many of these same items can be acquired elsewhere.
it is a bonus reward when the alliance shop is stocked bountifully.
The overall cost ratio of theory for the alliance shop appears to be that the shop can make about three times as much inventory with the same cost it would take for one member to purchase those same items from the alliance store.
### Alliance shop inventory sellouts
it is possible that one alliance member could save up and not alliance credits to purchase every single item in the alliance store.
if the Alliance store were to become depleted like this, then the cost would become massive to replenish the items to full stock in the Alliance store.
The Alliance member that makes the purchases in the alliance store is spending more alliance credits, then we'll be the cost to recover that inventory in the alliance store.
### Alliance credit revenue
This Alliance credit revenue section is based from as far as I have seen, upon the earliest glances at Rise of Kingdoms calculations.
as far as I know, Alliance credit revenue for both the alliance and the alliance member are gained at nearly an equal ratio, if not always at an equal ratio.
## speed ups
these speed ups help individual alliance members to be rewarded for their alliance contributions.
- having at least 15 1 minutes speed ups is good. 
- having at least four 15 minutes speed ups is good.
- having at least three 1 hour speed ups is good. 
- Alliance is low in Alliance credits income can deal with only one 3 hour speed boost.

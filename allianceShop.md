# Alliance shop
Alliance ranked number four members and Alliance leaders can load the Alliance shop up with inventory.
## individual and city development theory behind Alliance shops
The Alliance Shop is for giving back to individual Alliance members that have helped the Alliance grow.
most alliance leaders Will be excited to build flags for their alliance and put lower priority on the shop items.
Rise of Kingdoms gives the option for the Alliance leader to allow extra rewards for their individual members.
One of the biggest shop items that gives a alliance member reward is the civilization change item.
many members may feel purchasing a targeted teleport or an alliance teleport from the Alliance shop is a better value than buying elsewhere.
providing alliance members with options to spend their alliance credits down to zero before they leave to go to another alliance, is a good way to make sure that temporary members have a positive experience in your alliance.

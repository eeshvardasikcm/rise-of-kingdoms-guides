# Eeshvar Das Ayurveda and Mobile Games
## Resorting to Entertainment
## Easy Mind to Counter Stressful Work
Nearly equal amounts of time spent between,
playing mobile games,
and working a high stress job,
has been okay for me.
The negative health effect of the high stress job,
was shocking and sharply contrasted with my normal lifestyle.
When I started balancing mobile game playing,
with the stressful work,
the health contrast was reduced,
and I was able to move smoothly between work and recreation.
## Ayurveda is not a Mobile Game
## Finding Balance Between Recreation and Work
### The Space Between Recreation and Work 
## There are Better Forms of Recreation
## There are Better Ways to Work
## Productivity, Balance, Health, Happiness

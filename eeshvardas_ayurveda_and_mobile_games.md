# Eeshvar Das Ayurveda and Mobile Games
## Resorting to Entertainment
## Easy Mind to Counter Stressful Work
Nearly equal amounts of energy spent between,
playing mobile games,
and working a high stress job,
has been okay for me.
The negative health effect of the high stress job,
was shocking and sharply contrasted with my normal lifestyle.
When I started balancing mobile game playing,
with the stressful work,
the health contrast was reduced,
and I was able to move smoothly between work and recreation.
## Ayurveda is not a Mobile Game
My current philosophy is not an ayurvedic philosophy.
I have construed a practice of balancing mobile games with stressful work.
I have constructed this practice based from experience,
and also from ayurvedic philosophy.
I know means is This practice to be considered a practice of Ayurveda,.
last year,
and the year before last year,
My work was so stressful that,
The biggest barrier to my health was my work.
I decided this year was going to be different.
I reduced the amount of time permitted to work.
I allowed myself as much time as I felt necessary,
to playing mobile games,
as recreation.
I chose mobile games because,
mobile games is a safe playing field,
with no outside influences or concerns at all.
There is no way that anyone could be negatively affected,
by my playing of mobile games.
The effect outside influences have on my health,
are reduced significantly,
when I stay at home and play mobile games.
All of the work that I was assigned this year,
I finished.
it was very stressful,
to do all that much work.
I decided that if my biggest problem this year,
was playing too much mobile games,
then that would be a better year,
then the two previous years,
where stress from work,
was the major issue.
## Finding Balance Between Recreation and Work
I chose to play mobile games,
as frequently as I wanted to.
it turned out that I was putting,
about the same amount of energy,
into mobile games,
that I put into work,
this year.
Work was stressful.
mobile games caused me to be tired,
because of playing long hours at times.
Work was not as stressful as it was
the previous two years.
### The Space Between Recreation and Work 
now that I have a break in work,
I want to find a larger space,
between recreation and work.
I have found from my experience,
sometimes going straight to recreation,
after a long day of stressful work,
can cause low quality recreation.
if that recreation involves multiple people,
The chances of the stresses of work,
negatively impacting relationships,
becomes increased.
Right now, I don't have to changed too much.
All I have to do,
is gradually reduced the residual work I have.
while I am gradually reducing this residual work,
I am finding it helpful,
to continue playing mobile games.
I have noticed that My consciousness,
while playing mobile games,
is lighter and filled with thoughts,
of the liberating future I have.
each day,
My attachment to mobile games is reducing,
a proportionate amount,
to the amount that I reduce my work.
This change is,
naturally creating a,
larger space between
work and recreation.
### health is very important
health is the focus of attention right now.
I am increasing the amount of money I'm spending on health,
and increasing the amount of time I'm spending towards my health.
This gap between work and recreation,
I am modifying my habits,
to create
a healthier daily routine.
while I was working very many hours a week,
it was easy and productive,
to follow a proven daily routine.
now I can make additional adjustments to my daily routine.

## There are Better Ways to Work
### Productivity, Balance, Health, Happiness

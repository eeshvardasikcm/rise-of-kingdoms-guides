# realistic effect strategies
Rise of Kingdoms has many concepts that mirror real life today. 
most of the concepts mirror real life as it was in the medieval ages.
This realistic effect strategies guide will contain some of my realizations of these mirrors to realism within the PC and mobile game rise of kingdoms.
## military secrecy
You may want to keep the true strength of your military hidden from your alliance members.
### The use of bamboo
placing bamboo trees in between your main city buildings and your military buildings,
Will make travel to the military building's,
difficult even within your own city.
### military buildings along the back wall
pop up notifications will be harder to see,
when military buildings are away from the center of the city.
your eyes maybe attracted to engaging in other city activities more frequently.
The effect will be a reduced military touch of your own finger.
The less you touch your own military,
The less the whole kingdom will be able to see your military. 
### Don't ask for help with your military
when you are upgrading military relevant buildings,
and researching military relevant technologies,
Don't ask for help from your alliance members.
your alliance members may never know the actual level of some of your military buildings.
your military research may become entirely private also.
## The use of decorations
The more decorations you place in your city,
The more time it will take you to initiate production of new buildings.
in real life, it takes several months to build a new building sometimes.
### focusing on current buildings
by placing many decorations within your city,
You will be stuck with focusing on the current buildings that you already have.
You will have to either upgrade your city hall,
or move some buildings around,
in order to bring a new building into the complexity of your city.

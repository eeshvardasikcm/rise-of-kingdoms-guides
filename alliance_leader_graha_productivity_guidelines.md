## guidelines as ordered list of instructions in general guidelines on how to follow ordered list
go one character at a time starting at favorite character and ending at favorite character. favorite character should be your main alliance leader. in each character, follow the instructions in the following ordered lists one at a time without looping back to the first instruction in the list. when at the end of the list, move on to the next character. All other characters should not be favorites. All other characters should be iterated through from highest power to lowest power. should be no more than four normal characters. Don't engage in any game. play outside of these steps to maximize your personal productivity. The point is to allow Rise of Kingdoms players that are attracted to your alliance style to naturally join your alliance. if you have watched echo gaming, then you will know that echo gaming quit playing Rise of Kingdoms because of the large time commitment required by Rise of Kingdoms. echo gaming and some other game players prefer a smaller time commitment in games.

go one character at a time starting at favorite character and ending at favorite character. favorite character should be your main alliance leader. in each character, follow the instructions in the following ordered lists one at a time without looping back to the first instruction in the list. when at the end of the list, move on to the next character. All other characters should not be favorites. All other characters should be iterated through from highest power to lowest power. should be no more than four normal characters. Don't engage in any game. play outside of these steps to maximize your personal productivity.

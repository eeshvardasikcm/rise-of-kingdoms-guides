use of graha time management principles for being an alliance leader in rise of kingdoms. Graha is a time management, project management, and Ayurveda app by Eeshvar Das available on the Google Play store for newer Google security compliant devices.
## guidelines as ordered list of instructions in general guidelines on how to follow ordered list
go one character at a time starting at favorite character and ending at favorite character. favorite character should be your main alliance leader. in each character, follow the instructions in the following ordered lists one at a time without looping back to the first instruction in the list. when at the end of the list, move on to the next character. All other characters should not be favorites. All other characters should be iterated through from highest power to lowest power. should be no more than four normal characters. Don't engage in any game. play outside of these steps to maximize your personal productivity. The point is to allow Rise of Kingdoms players that are attracted to your alliance style to naturally join your alliance. if you have watched echo gaming, then you will know that echo gaming quit playing Rise of Kingdoms because of the large time commitment required by Rise of Kingdoms. echo gaming and some other game players prefer a smaller time commitment in games. I am creating this productivity guideline based from my graph app principles so that way I can increase my work productivity outside of recreation. You can follow these guidelines and you might find the same increases of productivity in your work. You may also find more time to add other types of recreation to your life.

3. Hit the mail button. Read and claim all non-personal mail. Don't handle personal mail yet.
4. Scan the recent kingdom chat, alliance chat and personal mail. send one or two messages relevant to Kingdom chat scan. relevancy of message can also be gained from banner that streams across the top of the screen. it may take some time for a response from the first message that is relevant. You may want to save your second response for some time. if no one has any relevant response to your first message, You may not need to send a second message. You can send an additional one or two messages in the alliance chat if needed. try to be concise. write the message in a way that you can leave and there will still be no misunderstanding or lingering communication needs. You can always check back tomorrow. do the same with personal mail as you did with alliance chat. there's no need to respond to every message. if you can blanket response to multiple people at the same time, that is okay. total you should be sending no more than five or six messages between all of these messaging options.

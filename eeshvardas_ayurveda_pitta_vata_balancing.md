The fall season in the United States region,
consists of summer pitta,
being moved by fall season vata.
## Rise of Kingdoms events and alliance loyalties
your alliance and rise of kingdoms,
maybe involved in calendared events.
doing these events on top of,
completing normal daily objectives,
in rise of kingdoms,
can double or even triple,
The amount of effort used,
playing Rise of Kingdoms.
### pitta's goal oriented
reducing daily objectives to,
following the alliance events,
or other particular desired events,
reduces the amount of goals,
and allows for variety in,
playing experience.
### vata's instability
The moving nature of vata,
Will not be pacified,
if there are too many different objectives.
logging in and targeting the particular event,
then logging out allows for stable mind.
The mind Will be more stable,
focusing on only one event at a time.
The body will be more stable,
when the mind is,
removed from gameplay,
and redirected to,
focusing on balancing pitta and vata doshas.

# Alliance leader Eeshvar Das productivity guidelines
Use of Graha time management principles for being an alliance leader in rise of kingdoms.
Graha is a time management, project management, and Ayurveda app by Eeshvar Das, available on the Google Play store, for newer Google security compliant devices.
I want to get my rise of kingdoms playing time down under 1 hour a day.
Then move my playing time down under 30 minutes a day.
After that I may be able to move my playing down to less than 15 or 5 minutes a day.
I will make adjustments to these guidelines to make those time management goals realized.
The reason I started playing mobile games again in the first place,
is because my work is very stressful,
and I have not had time to adjust to the large stress amounts,
by replacing my time with,
adequate Ayurveda and alternate recreation options.
Following these time management guidelines for mobile app play, 
will allow other types of recreation to open up,
and will maximize my Ayurveda gains.
I used to play EA FIFA Mobile Soccer quite often,
to give myself some reprieve from stress.
Now I am owning and managing my own league in EA FIFA Soccer, 
usually spending only five or 10 minutes a day maximum.
Playing mobile games has helped to improve my health,
during times of large stress from work.
There are better ways to improve health, 
and there are better forms of recreation.
I created extra characters simply to test the boundaries of the game a little bit.
I want to see if I'm going to be able to migrate members from other kingdoms into my main alliance.
These other characters may only require one small glance eventually.
The big test will be is Rise of Kingdoms the type of game that I can leave my alliance in productivity mode,
and still gain membership.
There is no way that I'm going to get drawn into a game that requires multiple hours a day to increase membership
My energy spend is far greater than monetary return gains from playing mobile apps.
I also get better gains from other types of recreation and socialization.
Graha app does not yet have integrated energy spend evaluations.
The Shrota considerate app and the Graha app, 
will have integrated energy spend and money spend thresholds integrated.
I recently read the terms of service for playing Rise of Kingdoms.
There is some general language that appears to allow some degree of marketing my own purposes in rise of kingdoms.
The main problem I had is with being a new player in a powerful kingdom.
The kingdom that my main character is in has had some large amount of anti-bullying chat in the kingdom chat space.
The terms of service for Rise of Kingdoms generalizes anti-bullying by apparently warning users to be careful what they say to other users.
I spent a large amount of time trying to arrange agreements with other alliances.
There should be sufficient chat and mail time allowed in these guidelines,
to keep relationships good.
## reduce character usage
Reducing character usage is a great way to increase productivity.
Creating alliances in a couple of other Kingdoms has helped to increase membership.
For time management reasons,
I'm going to reduce the amount of characters that I'm using,
by one character each day that there is no new members in that alliance.
This should easily reduce my time commitment to under 1/2 hour per day.
- reduce character usage by one each day.
- stop using the least powerful characters one at a time each day, if their alliance is not gaining members.
- it will be necessary to log in with inactive characters at least once every three days to maintain alliance leadership. if I still don't have membership increases in my alliance after 15 days, then I may dismantle the alliances.
- I can check inactive characters once every three days or even once every five or fifteen.
## guidelines as ordered list of instructions in general guidelines on how to follow ordered list
go one character at a time starting at favorite character and ending at favorite character. favorite character should be your main alliance leader. in each character, follow the instructions in the following ordered lists one at a time without looping back to the first instruction in the list. You can do up to step 12 and then stop if your character doing food and wood production only. at the end of the list, move on to the next character. All other characters should be iterated through from highest power to lowest power. should be no more than four normal characters. Don't engage in any gameplay outside of these steps to maximize your personal productivity. The point is to allow Rise of Kingdoms players that are attracted to your alliance style to naturally join your alliance. if you have watched echo gaming, then you will know that echo gaming quit playing Rise of Kingdoms because of the large time commitment required by Rise of Kingdoms. echo gaming and some other game players prefer a smaller time commitment in games. I am creating this productivity guideline based from my Graha app principles so that way I can increase my work productivity outside of recreation. You can follow these guidelines and you might find the same increases of productivity in your work. You may also find more time to add other types of recreation to your life.

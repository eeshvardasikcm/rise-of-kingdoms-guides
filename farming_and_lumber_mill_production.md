# Farming and lumber mill production
1. location. Make sure all your farms and lumber mills are in one location that is easily visible. I put easily visible buildings near the front wall of my city. that may require a small swipe to pay on the camera to the right and possibly down a little.
2. upgrading. Make sure all of your farms and lumber mills are upgraded to the same level that your city hall is. if any build cue has more than 15 seconds left on it and you don't have the proper speed boosts to speed up the process, go ahead and move on to the next step. You can always build more tomorrow.
3. building quantity. Make sure you have the maximum amount of farms and lumber meals built for your current city hall level.
4. boosts. activate food production, boost and wood production boost in the city management resource economy section. purchase new ones from the courier station. mysterious merchant has these boosts at a low cost.
5. City. upgrade your city hall to the next level at this time if possible

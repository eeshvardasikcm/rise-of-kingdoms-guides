# Migrating to a new kingdom follow along

## beginners migration
if you restrict your city hall below level eight, then you can use a beginners migration in most cases. 
## tolerance in upgrading to City Hall level 8
beginners migration no longer becomes possible after you upgrade your city hall to level eight.
acquiring the migration page now becomes an act of tolerance.
The easiest way to acquire the migration page is to get into a powerful alliance or create a merchant style alliance.
You will then be able to petition your alliance leadership to sell you a migration page.
if you create an alliance, You will be the first one in your alliance that will be able to buy a migration page for your character.
## acquiring the migration page

I have watched some tutorials on YouTube and it appears that in order to migrate to a new kingdom, you need to have a migration page item in rise of Kingdoms.

### gaining Alliance credits quickly by building flags at a very slow pace
The Alliance leaders in officers can put the migration page in the Alliance store. Alliance credits can be gained by individuals who build flags. All you have to do is help build a flag everyday. after the 24 hours is over, leave the flag and rejoin the flag. build again to ensure that your credits count restarts every 24 hours.
### Alliance members shop for the migration page
after several alliance members have helped to build flags and gain alliance credit, then they can use those credits to purchase the migration page and migrate to a New Kingdom.

## using the migration page
from what I remember when I watched the YouTube videos about Rise of kingdoms migration pages, The migration page can only be used periodically, possibly only once every 3 months. a short window opens up during a 3-month span for the migration page can be used to migrate to Kingdom versus kingdom play. Kingdom versus Kingdom play is a restart of the map. Members from various kingdoms are migrated into one new kingdom. The kingdom versus Kingdom kingdoms are less in number than the individual kingdoms that players start out and when they first create an account. some of the big players are in the Kingdom verse Kingdom zones.
I believe that migration pages are meant for only individuals, so if an alliance is going to move over to Kingdom versus Kingdom and maintain their alliance membership, they would have to be more to it than simply using migration pages as they're designed.

## My personal experience leading an alliance and trying to migrate my members to a new kingdom
I want to log status reports and track my progress in attempts to advance my alliance members to a new kingdom
### crude methods and trial and error
I'm not doing a lot of research advanced before starting this process. I'm going to use a crude process similar to the one I outlined above, and try to get all my members migrated to new kingdom.
The first thing I'm going to do is start to build a flag at a very slow pace.

#### slow pace flag building day one, two and three
The flag is starting to be built at 0% completion.
- October 12th, first flag: started building with one troop. placing a marker instructing My alliance members to build with one troop only. I went to sleep for the night, woke up later on the 13th. less than 12 hours elapsed and the flag had been completed building. I am assuming one of my alliance members failed to use only one troop and the flag building was done very quickly.
- October 13th, first analysis: it appears that Alliance credits are a large gain from the flag building. We have enough credits to build one or two more flags at the completion of the first flag.
- October 13th, second flag: started building a second flag with only one troop and the same marker instructing to use only one troop. I am also writing in the Alliance chat space doubling up the instruction to use only one troop. maybe this time the flag will build even slower.
- October 13th, third flag: started building a third flag. defense concerns became important suddenly today.
- October 14th, flags finished building. it appears that some alliance credits did go into the Alliance and the appearances that some of the members were able to keep some of the credits. We were able to buy and resell one migration page to one of our members. after talking with one of my lead advisors, We both agreed that we don't have a good enough plan to migrate our whole alliance over to Kingdom versus Kingdom. We decided to suspend our plans on migrating over to another kingdom as a whole alliance. there are integral parts of our alliance that I have decided to focus on that may lead to reaching this ultimate goal of moving our whole alliance over to Kingdom versus Kingdom and staying intact as the alliance we were in the previous kingdom 

## internal alliance loyalty and cooperation
communication inside Rise of Kingdoms and outside rise of Kingdoms appears to be an important part of being able to achieve what may be impossible. moving a whole alliance over to Kingdom versus Kingdom mode from their previous kingdom is not a normal function of the app Rise of Kingdoms.

### occasional blog entries concerning alliance loyalty and cooperation
- October 14th, as the leader of my alliance, I am making moves. that will help inform and educate my members better on how we will be able to make advances into larger game breaking moves including to migrating a whole Alliance into Kingdom versus Kingdom.
- October 15th, I have decided to increase the requirements of cooperation and loyalty so that way we can meet the desires of some of our alliance members. One of our higher ranking members desires that migration pages be distributed to all of our members. our goals overall include migrating to Kingdom versus Kingdom as a whole alliance in one group. The goal is that once we reach Kingdom verse Kingdom, We will then assemble together in the same alliance. these goals will require more cooperation and loyalty than we are currently having. We also need more out of app communication. The percentage of members that are participating in out of app communication is very low. The best I could do right now is increase in app cooperation and in-app loyalty.
- October 25th, The peacekeeping process has been going on for 10 days now. concerning the previous agreement with neighboring alliances. peace talks appear to be putting a stand still on cooperation within my province. talks appeared to be improving gradually. We have been having excellent internal Alliance cooperation as far as the appearance goes.

### using the beginners migration page as an alliance leader blog entries
- October 25th, I have created extra characters for purposes of testing. how to migrate a whole alliance from one kingdom to another or even indicate them versus kingdom. I'm going to run some tests today, to determine whether it's possible to move the four letter tag for the alliance name to another kingdom.
- October 25th, I noted down the alliance tag in a separate location. now I am disbanding the alliance. this process takes 1 hour.
- October 25th, My alliance was successfully disbanded. within a matter of 10 minutes, I was able to migrate to a different kingdom, and create a new alliance with the same alliance tag. because no one had taken my alliance tag during that 10 minute, My Alliance tag was still available.

# Migrating to a new kingdom follow along

## acquiring the migration page
I have watched some tutorials on YouTube and it appears that in order to migrate to a new kingdom, you need to have a migration page item in rise of Kingdoms.

### gaining Alliance credits quickly by building flags at a very slow pace
The Alliance leaders in officers can put the migration page in the Alliance store. Alliance credits can be gained by individuals who build flags. All you have to do is help build a flag everyday. after the 24 hours is over, leave the flag and rejoin the flag. build again to ensure that your credits count restarts every 24 hours.
### Alliance members shop for the migration page
after several alliance members have helped to build flags and gain alliance credit, then they can use those credits to purchase the migration page and migrate to a New Kingdom.

## using the migration page
from what I remember when I watched the YouTube videos about Rise of kingdoms migration pages, The migration page can only be used periodically, possibly only once every 3 months. a short window opens up during a 3-month span for the migration page can be used to migrate to Kingdom versus kingdom play. Kingdom versus Kingdom play is a restart of the map. Members from various kingdoms are migrated into one new kingdom. The kingdom versus Kingdom kingdoms are less in number than the individual kingdoms that players start out and when they first create an account. some of the big players are in the Kingdom verse Kingdom zones.

## My personal experience leading an alliance and trying to migrate my members to a new kingdom
I want to log status reports and track my progress in attempts to advance my alliance members to a new kingdom
### crude methods and trial and error
I'm not doing a lot of research advanced before starting this process. I'm going to use a crude process similar to the one I outlined above, and try to get all my members migrated to new kingdom.
The first thing I'm going to do is start to build a flag at a very slow pace.

#### slow pace flag building day one
The flag is starting to be built at 0% completion.
- October 13th, first flag: started building with one troop. placing a marker instructing My alliance members to build with one troop only. I went to sleep for the night, woke up later on the 13th. less than 12 hours elapsed and the flag had been completed building. I am assuming one of my alliance members failed to use only one troop and the flag building was done very quickly.
- October 13th, first analysis: it appears that Alliance credits are a large gain from the flag building. We have enough credits to build one or two more flags at the completion of the first flag.
- October 13th, second flag: started building a second flag with only one troop and the same marker instructing to use only one troop. I am also writing in the Alliance chat space doubling up the instruction to use only one troop. maybe this time the flag will build even slower.
